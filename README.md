Introduction
------------

**railOmniverse is an extension** to the [NVIDIA Omniverse Environment](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse) \[[1](#[1])\]. railOmniverse makes available railroad simulation functionality from the Trend trax library to Windows and Linux platforms.

The general functionality, the trax library provides, is described in this book; an overview is given with the article ['Trax Track Library'](https://www.trendverlag.com/Trax/Doc/BlogArticle/traxLibrary.html) \[[3](#[3])\]

An overview about the actual content of the railOmniverse extension, you'll find on the main page of the [railOmniverse Manual](https://www.trendverlag.com/Trax/Doc/railDocumentation/Html/index.html) \[[9](#[9])\].

  

Demo Version
------------

**The demo version of railOmniverse** \[[10](#[10])\] is a free version of the extension. It is limited in functionality and is intended to give an impression of the capabilities of the full version. The demo version is available for [download](https://www.trendverlag.com/rail/railOmniverse0_12_0-Demo.zip).

TODO
----

**Railroading is a never ending endeavour.** So we maintain a list of planned features to be realised in upcomming versions of the plugin. The list is alive and roughly ordered by priority;

1.  **TFC:** Create a library of standard traction force characteristics. Or even better: some generator.
2.  **BasisCurves:** implement support for more than cubic Bezier curves. Support different curve types like BSpline and CatmullRom etc ...
3.  **RollingStock**: a management class for assembling rolling stock with track joint, hinges and couplings. Railing the object automatically and exactly at arbitrary track locations; spinning wheel 3D-models (animated); targeting all WheelFrames by one steering input, etc ...
4.  **Train**: a management class for maintaining coupled rolling stock. Rail/unrail; targeting all rolling stock by one steering input. Coupling and uncoupling, etc ...
5.  **Sensor system**: relay several events that happen along the tracks.
6.  **Signal system**: communicate with a train from outside over a track interval.
7.  **Jacks & Plugs system**: logically connecting elements like switches, signals and sensors. Receving events e.g. to play sounds or to trigger animations.
8.  ...

This does not mean we will do it any time soon. It all depends on demand. So if you have a demand, please let us know ...
